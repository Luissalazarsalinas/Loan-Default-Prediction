An end-to-end Machine Learning Project to predict Loan Default.

## **Problem Statement**
Small Business Administration(SBA) is an agency of the Federal Government that exists to serve, support, and protect the interests of small businesses. One way SBA assist these small business enterprises is through a loan guarantee program which is designed to encourage the bank to grant loans to small business. But, since SBA loans only guarantee a portion of the entire loan balance, banks will incur some losses if a small business defaults on its SBA-guaranteed loan. Therefore, banks are still faced with a difficult choice as to whether they should grant such a loan because of the high risk of default. One way to uniform their decision-making is through analyzing relevant historical data.

This Streamlit App utilizes a Machine Learning model served as an API with FastAPI framework in order to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on the following criteria: hours, type of transaction, amount, balance before and after transaction etc.

The machine learning model used for this web application was deployed as an API using the FastAPI framework and then accessed through a frontend interface with Streamlit.

The App can be viewed through this link

The API and its documentation can be viewed here or here.
